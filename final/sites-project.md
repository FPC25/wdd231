I chose this project because it combines practical family needs with business potential:

2. **Business Opportunity:** Home-based food entrepreneurs need tools to:

    - Calculate accurate pricing
    - Track ingredient costs
    - Determine profitable selling prices
    - Maintain consistent quality

3. **Technical Requirements:** The project naturally incorporates all required elements:

    - Form handling

    - Responsive design
    - Image optimization
    - Accessibility considerations

This project serves both home cooks preserving family traditions and entrepreneurs starting food businesses, making it practical and purposeful.
