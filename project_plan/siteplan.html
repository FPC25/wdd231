        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          To provide an easy-to-use platform for managing and sharing recipes,
          with built-in cost calculation and organization tools. This project
          addresses two main needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Families:</strong> Preserve and share recipes across
            generations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Food Entrepreneurs:</strong> Calculate costs, set prices,
            and maintain quality for business success.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
          Scenarios are questions asked by a site visitor who represents the
          organization's target audience. These questions help drive the content
          of the website by providing answers to the visitor's needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario 1:</strong> A home cook wants to preserve their
            grandmother's recipes and share them with family members. They ask:
            "How can I organize and share my family recipes in one place?"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scenario 2:</strong> A food entrepreneur is starting a
            home-based bakery and needs to calculate costs for their products.
            They ask: "How can I calculate the cost of ingredients and determine
            the best price for my baked goods?"
          </li>

                    Input Fields: The background of the search bar input field.

                    slightly darker #F5EFE6 main background.

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Two fonts are used to create a harmonious and functional design:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lora (The Display & Heading Font)</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Description:</em> Lora is a well-balanced, contemporary
                serif font with a calligraphic feel. In this design, it is used
                to give the application a warm, inviting, and slightly classic
                personality, much like a cherished cookbook. Its moderate
                contrast makes it excellent for display purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Usage:</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Main Logo: The "Flavorfy" brand name is the most prominent
                    use of Lora, likely in a bold weight to be impactful and
                    memorable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Section Headings: Major section titles like "Favorites" and
                    "Your Recipes" use Lora to create a clear and elegant visual
                    hierarchy, guiding the user's eye through the page content.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Card Titles: The title of each recipe (e.g., "Ratatouille")
                    also appears to use Lora, but at a smaller size and possibly
                    a regular weight. This maintains a consistent, sophisticated
                    style within the content blocks themselves.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UI Elements & Navigation: All interactive and functional
                    text uses Roboto. This includes:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The navigation buttons on desktop ("Home," "Cookbook,"
                        "Calculator").
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Action links and labels like "Add your recipe +" and
                        "More recipes +".
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Roboto (The Body & UI Font)</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Description:</em> Roboto is a geometric sans-serif font
                known for its excellent readability on screens of all sizes. It
                serves as the "workhorse" font for the interface, presenting
                information clearly and cleanly without distracting from the
                content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Usage:</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Paragraph/Description Text: The short descriptions within
                    the recipe cards ("Lorem ipsum") would use Roboto for
                    optimal legibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Footer Text: Any text in the footer or other secondary
                    information areas would also use Roboto.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why This Combination Works</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This pairing creates a strong, user-friendly visual hierarchy.
                The elegance of Lora draws users to key titles and branding
                elements, giving the app a professional and appealing "flavor."
                Simultaneously, the clean utility of Roboto makes the interface
                effortless to read and navigate, ensuring a smooth and
                functional user experience.
